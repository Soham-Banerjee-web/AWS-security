# AWS-security
Here is a detailed AWS security project design involving a VPC, subnets, gateways, and security groups tailored for securely publishing code to GitHub (e.g., from EC2 instances or CI/CD pipelines hosted in AWS):

## AWS Security Project Design with VPC, Subnets, Gateways, and Security Groups for GitHub Publishing

### 1. **VPC Creation**

- Create a custom Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with a CIDR block, e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`, to provide a large private IP address space for your network resources[1][2][3].

### 2. **Subnet Design**

- Create **Public Subnets** (e.g., `10.0.1.0/24`) in at least two Availability Zones (AZs) to host resources that require internet access, such as bastion hosts or NAT gateways[4][5].
- Create **Private Subnets** (e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`) in the same AZs for hosting your application servers or build servers that will publish code to GitHub but should not be directly accessible from the internet[1][4][5].

### 3. **Gateways**

- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC to enable internet access for resources in public subnets (e.g., bastion hosts, NAT gateways)[1][2][3].
- **NAT Gateway:** Deploy NAT Gateways in each public subnet/AZ to allow instances in private subnets to access the internet securely for outbound connections (such as pushing code to GitHub) without exposing them to inbound internet traffic[1][4][5].

### 4. **Route Tables**

- Create a **Public Route Table** associated with the public subnets that routes `0.0.0.0/0` traffic to the Internet Gateway.
- Create a **Private Route Table** associated with private subnets that routes `0.0.0.0/0` traffic to the NAT Gateway(s) for outbound internet access[1][4][2].

### 5. **Security Groups**

- Create security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level:
  - For **bastion hosts** in the public subnet, allow inbound SSH (port 22) only from trusted IPs (e.g., your office IP)[1][6].
  - For **application/build servers** in private subnets, allow inbound traffic only from specific sources (e.g., the bastion host or load balancer) and restrict outbound traffic to GitHub IP ranges or domain (e.g., HTTPS port 443) to securely push code[1][7][6].
  - By default, allow all outbound traffic from private instances to enable NAT gateway usage, but restrict inbound traffic tightly[1][7].

### 6. **Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)**

- Optionally, configure stateless NACLs on subnets for an additional layer of security by explicitly allowing or denying traffic at the subnet level, complementing security groups[1][2].

### 7. **Additional Security Enhancements**

- Enable **VPC Flow Logs** to monitor network traffic for auditing and troubleshooting[7].
- Use **AWS IAM roles and policies** to securely manage permissions for EC2 instances or CI/CD tools interacting with GitHub[7].
- Optionally deploy a **bastion host** for secure SSH access to private instances, avoiding direct internet exposure[1][6].
- Consider **AWS Network Firewall** or **GuardDuty** for advanced threat detection and network protection[7].

### 8. **Example Workflow for GitHub Publishing**

- Developers or CI/CD pipelines connect securely to EC2 instances in private subnets via bastion host or VPN.
- EC2 instances use NAT Gateway to establish outbound HTTPS connections to GitHub to push code.
- Security groups restrict inbound access to only trusted sources and allow outbound HTTPS traffic to GitHub.
- VPC Flow Logs and GuardDuty monitor for suspicious activity.

| Component           | Configuration                                   | Purpose                                          |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| VPC                 | CIDR `10.0.0.0/16`                             | Isolated virtual network                         |
| Public Subnets      | `10.0.1.0/24` (in multiple AZs)                | Hosts NAT Gateway, bastion hosts, internet-facing resources |
| Private Subnets     | `10.0.2.0/24` (in multiple AZs)                | Hosts build/app servers, no direct internet access |
| Internet Gateway    | Attached to VPC                                 | Enables internet access for public subnet       |
| NAT Gateway         | Deployed in public subnet(s)                    | Enables private subnet instances to access internet outbound |
| Route Tables        | Public RT → IGW; Private RT → NAT Gateway      | Routes traffic appropriately                      |
| Security Groups     | Inbound SSH restricted; outbound HTTPS to GitHub | Controls traffic to/from instances                |
| Network ACLs        | Optional stateless filtering                     | Additional subnet-level security                   |
| VPC Flow Logs       | Enabled                                         | Monitor network traffic                            |
